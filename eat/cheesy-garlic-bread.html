    <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
    <p><i>For the Pizza Base</i><br>
      3/4 cup lukewarm water<br>
      1 tsp active-dry yeast<br>
      2 cups flour (I use either AP flour or bread flour)<br>
      1 1/2 tsp salt<br>
      <br>
      Corn meal (Optional)<br>
      <br>
      For the Toppings <br>
      3 tbsp butter, softened<br>
      4 tsp minced garlic (you can use more or less depending how garlicky you like it!)<br>
      2 cups mozzarella cheese<br>
      <br>
      Additional optional toppings<br>
      Onion, chopped<br>
      Mushrooms, chopped<br>
      <br>
      Oregano and black pepper to taste<br></p>

      <h2>DIRECTIONS</h2>
      Preheat oven to 500Â°F.<br>
      Add parchment paper on top of a large round baking sheet and sprinkle on corn meal (optional).<br><br>

      For Pizza Base:<br>
      In a large mixing bowl add the water and yeast. Mix together until the yeast is dissolved and looks like a kind of miso soup.<br>
      Add in the flour and salt and mix together to form a shaggy dough.
      On a clean surface, tip out the dough mixture and make sure to scrape out any flour that is not yet incorporated. Start to knead the dough. Add a small amount of flour if the dough becomes too sticky.<br>
      The dough should feel smooth, elastic and slightly tacky when it is ready.<br>
      Divide the dough into 2 pieces and make each piece into a ball shape. Put the mixing bowl upside down to cover the dough pieces.<br>

      At this point you have a couple of options depending how much time you have.<br>
      You can simply let it rest a little while you are preparing your toppings and use it pretty much right away or if you have time, you can let it rise for about an hour and a half.<br>
      Personally, I think it tastes a little better if you leave it to rise for a little while, but I have also used it right away and it still tastes delicious. It is a little easier to work with when it has been left to rise too.<br><br>

      When you are ready to make the pizzas take the first piece of pizza dough and place it into the middle of the parchment paper that you places on the cookie sheet. Start to stretch out the dough to form a pizza. For an extra thin crust you can roll it out with a rolling pin. If the dough is a little difficult to work with and keeps stretching back just let it rest for a few minutes then continue working.<br><br>

      Once the dough is stretched out you can repeat this for the second piece of dough, or if you don't need an extra pizza you can always refrigerate it for up to 3 days.<br><br>

      <i>For the toppings</i><br>
      In a small mixing bowl add the softened butter and garlic. Mix together until the garlic looks evenly dispersed.<br>
      Take half of the mixture and add it to the center of the first pizza base. With the back of a spoon, spread the garlic butter all over the pizza base.<br>
      If you want to use onions and/or mushrooms, then add those next at this point.<br>
      Sprinkle 1 cup of mozzarella cheese over the top evenly.<br>
      Repeat for the second pizza.<br><br>

      Bake for 5 minutes, then turn pizza and bake for a further 3 minutes until cheese is bubbling.
      <br><br>
      Enjoy!
